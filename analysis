<h1>NYC Land Value Tax (LVT) Analysis</h1>

<p>This page summarizes an analysis of replacing New York City's <strong>property, personal income, and sales taxes</strong> with a <strong>land value tax (LVT)</strong> set at <em>13%</em> of land value. The LVT would be voluntary initially, allowing taxpayers to choose between the old tax system or LVT. Over time, old taxes would increase to encourage switching.</p>

<h2>Phased Tax Increase Strategy for Old Taxes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase City Income Tax</strong> progressively on high earners remaining in the old system — politically palatable and progressive.</li>
  <li><strong>Modest increase in local sales tax</strong> (0.25–0.5%) if needed to close revenue gaps — regressive but less visible.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid increasing property taxes initially</strong> to protect homeowners and preserve incentives to switch to LVT.</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a <em>cost incentive</em> for taxpayers to switch to the land value tax, encouraging a gradual transition without sudden shocks.</p>

<h2>How Might the Wealthy Avoid Paying More?</h2>

<blockquote>
  Wealthy taxpayers may attempt:<br />
  • To undervalue land or challenge assessments.<br />
  • To shift wealth into non-land assets outside NYC.<br />
  • To delay switching while lobbying politically.<br />
  • To use complex ownership structures or parcel fragmentation.<br />
  • To pass costs to tenants or customers.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Policy counters include:</strong> transparent land valuation, beneficial ownership disclosure, aggregation rules, vacancy surcharges, and linking LVT revenue to popular services to maintain political support.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A voluntary 13% NYC Land Value Tax replacing property, income, and sales taxes would:<br />
- Provide significant relief to renters and low-income households.<br />
- Shift substantial tax burdens onto land-rich households and commercial landowners.<br />
- Encourage efficient land use and discourage speculation.<br />
- Require carefully phased increases in old taxes (mainly income tax) to maintain revenue and drive LVT adoption.<br />
- Need strong anti-avoidance measures to prevent gaming.</p>
