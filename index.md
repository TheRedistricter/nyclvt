# NYC Land Value Tax (LVT) Analysis

**Replacing Property, Income & Sales Taxes with a Voluntary 13% LVT**

---

## üîç Overview

This is an analysis of a proposal to let New York City taxpayers **choose** between:

* Continuing under the traditional tax system (property, income, and sales taxes),
  **or**
* Opting into a **13% Land Value Tax (LVT)** on the value of land only.

To encourage migration, the **old taxes will gradually increase** to make the LVT more appealing. Over time, most revenue would come from the LVT, simplifying the system and aligning incentives.

## üìä Taxpayer Impact by Income Level

| Household Type                                             | Current Taxes (Prop + Income + Sales) | LVT Tax (13% of Land) | Difference     | Notes                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Low-Income Renter (\~\$30K income)**                     | \$1,600                               | \$0                   | **‚Äì\$1,600**   | Doesn‚Äôt own land, avoids all taxes under LVT |
| **Middle-Income Homeowner (\~\$120K income, \$800K home)** | \$11,500                              | \$31,200              | **+\$19,700**  | Large increase if land value is high         |
| **High-Income Owner (\~\$1.2M income, \$6M land)**         | \$118,500                             | \$780,000             | **+\$661,500** | Reflects high land wealth                    |
| **Commercial Landowner (\$30M property, \$10.5M land)**    | \$390,000                             | \$1,365,000           | **+\$975,000** | Huge shift toward land-based burden          |

## üè¢ Commercial Landowners: Impact by Profit Margin

Assuming \$6M annual revenue and \$10.5M land value:

| Profit Margin | Pre-Tax Profit | Current Taxes | Net Profit (Now) | LVT Tax     | Net Profit (LVT) | Change     | LVT Tax as % of Profit |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 5%            | \$300,000      | \$390,000     | ‚Äì\$90,000        | \$1,365,000 | ‚Äì\$1,065,000     | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **456%**               |
| 10%           | \$600,000      | \$390,000     | \$210,000        | \$1,365,000 | ‚Äì\$765,000       | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **228%**               |
| 15%           | \$900,000      | \$390,000     | \$510,000        | \$1,365,000 | ‚Äì\$465,000       | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **152%**               |
| 20%           | \$1,200,000    | \$390,000     | \$810,000        | \$1,365,000 | ‚Äì\$165,000       | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **114%**               |
| 25%           | \$1,500,000    | \$390,000     | \$1,110,000      | \$1,365,000 | \$135,000        | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **91%**                |
| 30%           | \$1,800,000    | \$390,000     | \$1,410,000      | \$1,365,000 | \$435,000        | ‚Äì\$975,000 | **76%**                |

üß† **Takeaway**: Low-margin commercial operators would be hardest hit, but landowners who fully utilize their sites or convert land to more productive uses would benefit over time.

## üß≠ Phased Strategy for Increasing Old Taxes

To fund the system while encouraging LVT adoption:

### ‚úÖ 1. Increase NYC Income Tax (Progressively)

* Add surcharges only for **non-LVT taxpayers**
* Only impact higher brackets (e.g. >\$150K)

### ‚úÖ 2. Modest Increase to Local Sales Tax

* Raise by **0.25‚Äì0.5%**
* Keep core goods (food, rent, meds) exempt

### ‚ùå 3. Avoid Property Tax Increases (Initially)

* Too politically risky
* Undermines incentives to switch to LVT

## üß† How the Rich Will Try to Avoid LVT (and How to Stop Them)

| Strategy                          | Defense                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Undervaluing land**             | Transparent land assessments, zoning-based valuation        |
| **Using LLCs, offshore entities** | Mandatory beneficial ownership disclosure                   |
| **Parcel splitting**              | Aggregate assessments for commonly controlled parcels       |
| **Lobbying to delay transition**  | Tie LVT revenue to popular programs (e.g. transit, housing) |
| **Hoarding vacant land**          | Vacancy surcharges or higher LVT tiers                      |

## ‚úÖ Why They May Eventually Switch Anyway

As old taxes rise:

* High earners will pay **more in income + property + sales taxes** than they would under LVT
* LVT becomes the **cheaper**, simpler option
* LVT eliminates the tax on buildings, income, and productivity ‚Äî just pay for the land you control

---

## üßæ Summary

A **voluntary LVT transition** with a fixed 13% rate can:

* Help renters and low-income residents
* Shift tax burdens to land-rich individuals and firms
* Incentivize denser, more productive land use
* Maintain political support through gradual opt-in and progressive replacement
* Discourage speculation and vacant land hoarding
